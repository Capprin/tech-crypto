Cryptography and encryption instructional code written for iD Tech Camps

Includes implementation of Hashing (MD5) and Symmetric Encryption (Blowfish)

Simpler examples include a shift cipher, XOR encryption, and a (slightly) broken implementation of RSA.
- Note on RSA: It functions for small inital primes and lowercase letters. For larger numbers it breaks because of the size limit on a char datatype (which is what I use to store information). A fix will probably come later.
